# Lab Report 2 - Servers and Bugs (Week 3)

As with the first lab report, you'll write this as a Github Pages page, then
print that page to PDF and upload to Gradescope. There are 3 parts:

## Part 1

Write a web server called `StringServer` that supports the path and behavior
described below. It should keep track of a single string that gets added to by
incoming requests. The requests should look like this:

```
/add-message?s=<string>
```

The effect of this request is to concatenate a new line (`\n`) and the string
after `=` to the running string, and then respond with the entire string so far.

So, for example, after

```
/add-message?s=Hello
```

The page should show

```
Hello
```

and after

```
/add-message?s=How are you
```

the page should show

```
Hello
How are you
```

Show the code for your `StringServer`, and two screenshots of using `/add-message`.

For **each** of the two screenshots, describe:

- Which methods in your code are called?
- What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any
  relevant fields of the class?
- How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this
  specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.

By _values_, we mean specific `String`s, `int`s, `URI`s, and so on. `"abc"` is a
value, `456` is a value, `new URI("http://...")` is a value, and so on.)

## Part 2

Choose one of the bugs from lab 3.

Provide:

- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
- An input that _doesn't_ induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

## Part 3

In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3
that you didn't know before.
